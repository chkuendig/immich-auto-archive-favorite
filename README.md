#  ‚ù§Ô∏èüì¶ Immich Auto Favorite/Archive 
This is a simple Python script (and a Docker container), that automatically marks images as favorite or archived depending on their rating in the Exif Metadata. The primary idea is to use this in combination with a backup script for another library (e.g. [icloudpd](https://github.com/icloud-photos-downloader/icloud_photos_downloader/) which marks hidden/deleted and favorite images with an exif rating in the xmp sidecar).
